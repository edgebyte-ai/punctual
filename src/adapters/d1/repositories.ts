/**
 * D1 repository implementations (ADR-0003 §3, ADR-0007 §1).
 *
 * Two things make this file load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. Every read goes through a `D1DatabaseSession`, never `db.prepare()`
 *    directly. Cloudflare's docs are explicit that standard queries default to
 *    the primary instance, so a bare prepare() silently sends a Sydney guest's
 *    booking page to a US primary and quietly loses the <100 ms wedge.
 *
 * 2. `createWithLocks` is the anti-double-booking invariant. The booking row
 *    and its slot_locks rows go into ONE batch(), so a conflicting bucket
 *    fails the whole thing. Verified against production D1.
 *
 * Nothing here knows about tenants. The cloud control-plane wraps these with
 * an implementation that closes over tenant_id.
