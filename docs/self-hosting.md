# Self-hosting Punctual

Zero to a working booking link in about 15 minutes, on Cloudflare's free tier,
for $0.

You need a Cloudflare account and Node 20+. You do **not** need a paid
Cloudflare plan, a database server, Docker, or a credit card.

## 1. Get the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CCCrafts/punctual.git
cd punctual
npm install
npx wrangler login
```

## 2. Create the three resources

```bash
npx wrangler d1 create punctual
npx wrangler kv namespace create CACHE
npx wrangler r2 bucket create punctual-avatars
```

The first two commands print an id; `r2 bucket create` does not — R2 buckets
are addressed by the name you gave them. Put them in `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "punctual"
database_id = "<the id from d1 create>"

[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "CACHE"
id = "<the id from kv namespace create>"

[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "AVATARS"
bucket_name = "punctual-avatars"
```

D1 stores everything durable. KV caches only external calendars' busy times —
never your bookings, which are always read from D1 so you see your own writes
immediately. R2 stores host avatars and team logos — durable, not a cache,
but not gated behind a paid plan either: R2's free tier (10 GB storage, no
egress fee) is part of the same $0-to-start deal as D1 and KV.

## 3. Set two secrets

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32 | npx wrangler secret put ENCRYPTION_KEY_V1
openssl rand -base64 32 | npx wrangler secret put SIGNING_KEY
```

`ENCRYPTION_KEY_V1` encrypts calendar refresh tokens at rest (AES-GCM).
`SIGNING_KEY` signs the reschedule and cancel links in your emails.

**Keep both.** Losing `ENCRYPTION_KEY_V1` means every host must reconnect their
calendar. Rotating it later is supported — add `ENCRYPTION_KEY_V2` and the
engine decrypts with the old key while encrypting with the new one.

## 4. Create the schema and deploy

```bash
npm run migrate
npm run deploy
```

`wrangler deploy` prints your Worker's URL. Put it in `wrangler.toml`'s
`BASE_URL` (every link the engine writes into emails, OAuth callbacks and
manage pages is built from it) and deploy once more. Until you do, the
Worker refuses to serve rather than quietly generating dead links.

## 5. Connect a calendar

Punctual talks to Google Calendar and Microsoft 365 using **your own** OAuth
application. That is more setup than a hosted service, and it is also why no
one else can see your calendar data.

### Google

1. In [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a
   project and enable the **Google Calendar API**.
2. Configure the OAuth consent screen. While it is unverified you can add up to
   100 test users, which is plenty for a team.
3. Create an **OAuth client ID** of type *Web application* with both redirect
   URIs below registered — sign-in and calendar connect are deliberately
   separate flows, so a leaked code for one can never be exchanged against
   the other's endpoint:

```
https://<your-worker-url>/auth/google/callback?purpose=identity
https://<your-worker-url>/auth/google/callback?purpose=calendar
```

4. Set the credentials:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
npx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Calendar scopes are classed as *sensitive* by Google. Verification takes weeks,
so start it early if you plan to go past 100 users. Until then the consent
screen shows an "unverified app" warning; for an internal team that is fine.

### Microsoft

1. In [Entra ID → App registrations](https://entra.microsoft.com/), register an
   application. Under **Supported account types**, pick "Accounts in any
   organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts" — the narrower
   single-tenant option only lets people inside your own 365 tenant connect,
   which locks out any guest or teammate on a different tenant or a personal
   Outlook.com account.
2. Entra's registration screen only accepts one redirect URI, and rejects one
   with a query string ("URL may not contain a query string") — a limit that
   also applies later, on the **Authentication** blade, unlike Google. So:
   register with a bare URI first, `https://<your-worker-url>/auth/microsoft/callback`,
   then go to **Authentication** → **Add URI** and add both real ones (path
   segments, not query params — this is the one place Microsoft's redirect
   URI shape differs from Google's):
   ```
   https://<your-worker-url>/auth/microsoft/callback/identity
   https://<your-worker-url>/auth/microsoft/callback/calendar
   ```
   Remove the bare placeholder once both are in. Also on this blade: enable
   **ID tokens** under "Implicit grant and hybrid flows" — the identity flow
   needs it.
3. Grant delegated Graph permissions (**API permissions** → Add a permission
   → Microsoft Graph → Delegated): `openid`, `email`, `profile` (usually
   already present), `offline_access`, `Calendars.ReadWrite`. No admin
   consent needed — these are all per-user delegated grants.
4. Set `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` and `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET` the same way.

## 6. Email (optional, but you want it)

Without an email provider, Punctual logs emails instead of sending them —
useful for local testing, not for real bookings. This is a real trap: nothing
in the product looks broken, because only the recipients can tell. If you skip
this step, the dashboard and `/health` will both keep saying so (see
Troubleshooting).

There are three ways to send. On Cloudflare the first needs no API key at all.

### Cloudflare Email Service

The `send_email` binding is itself the credential, scoped by `wrangler.toml` —
nothing to rotate, leak, or forget to set. Your domain must be on Cloudflare
DNS, and sending to guests needs a Workers Paid plan.

Do these in order:

1. **Onboard the sending domain.** Cloudflare dashboard → **Compute → Email
   Service → Email Sending → Onboard Domain**. Cloudflare adds MX, SPF and
   DKIM records under `cf-bounce.<your-domain>`, plus DMARC at
   `_dmarc.<your-domain>`; allow 5–15 minutes.

   It does not touch your apex MX, so an existing mailbox provider on the same
   domain (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365) keeps working — different DKIM
   selectors, and the return path lives on the `cf-bounce` subdomain. Email
   *Routing* is the feature that would conflict there; this is not that.

2. **Set `FROM_EMAIL` to an address on the domain you onboarded.** Onboarding
   `mail.example.com` does not authorise `you@example.com`: the sender address
   must belong to an onboarded domain, or every send is rejected.

3. **Uncomment the binding** in `wrangler.toml`:

   ```toml
   [[send_email]]
   name = "EMAIL"
   ```

4. **Deploy, then sign in.** The sign-in link is the one email Punctual sends
   on the request path rather than through the queue, so a sender that is not
   authorised fails immediately and visibly — before a guest ever books.

The order matters. Do 3 and 4 before 1 and you get a window where the
dashboard and `/health` both read healthy while no mail arrives, because the
"email is not configured" warning only fires for the console sender — and with
a binding present, a provider *is* configured.

### Resend or Brevo

Set **either** provider's key (Resend is tried first if both are set, and
either key takes precedence over a `send_email` binding):

To take the guessing out of it, name the sender in `[vars]`:
`EMAIL_PROVIDER = "cloudflare"` (or `resend`, `brevo`, `console`). Then a
missing key or binding for the one you named shows up on `/health` and the
dashboard as `email_provider_unavailable`, instead of mail quietly going
through whatever else is set.

```bash
npx wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY
# or
npx wrangler secret put BREVO_API_KEY
```

Then set `FROM_EMAIL` and `FROM_NAME` in `wrangler.toml` `[vars]` to an address
on a domain you have verified with your provider. Configure SPF, DKIM and
DMARC on that domain — booking confirmations that land in spam are worse than
no email at all.

## 7. Make it yours

Everything a guest sees can carry your identity instead of the defaults.

1. **Sign in first — you're the admin.** The first account created on a
   fresh deployment gets the admin role: an **Admin** page appears in the
   dashboard with the user list (grant or remove admin; the last admin can
   never be demoted) and the sign-up policy — open, closed, or an allowlist
   of emails and `@domains`. When everyone who should have an account has
   one, close sign-ups there. Existing users keep signing in.

   Prefer configuration as code? Setting the `SIGNUPS` variable (same
   values: `open`, `closed`, or a comma list) **pins** the policy — the
   Admin page then shows it read-only and the stored setting is ignored.

   Upgrading an existing deployment where nobody is admin yet? Promote
   yourself once:

   ```bash
   npx wrangler d1 execute punctual --remote \
     --command "UPDATE users SET role='admin' WHERE email='you@acme.com'"
   ```

2. **Fill in your profile** at Dashboard → Settings: photo, name, position,
   company, and a company link. The photo and identity line ("CEO, Acme Inc",
   with the company linking to your site) render on your booking pages and in
   guest confirmation emails; your company also anchors the booking page's
   footer.

3. **Name the operator.** `BRAND_NAME` in `[vars]` is the product name shown
   in the footer and emails; `LEGAL_OPERATOR` is the legal entity named on
   `/privacy` and `/terms`. Set the latter to your actual company if this
   goes past internal use.

4. **Put a live demo on your landing page.** Once you have a real event
   type, set `DEMO_BOOKING_PATH` in `[vars]` (e.g. `/jo/30min`) and your
   deployment's home page embeds that booking page live.

Every booking form also asks one built-in optional question — "What would
you like to discuss?" — whose answer flows to the calendar event and both
confirmation emails. To reword it or make it required, add your own line
starting with `Agenda |` to the event type's questions (e.g.
`Agenda | textarea | required`); your version replaces the built-in one.

**Your front page.** By default `/` is the Punctual landing. On the Admin
page, under *Homepage*, switch it to *This instance*: your company logo, a
title and an intro (links and addresses become clickable), your website
and a contact address, and the booking links you pick from your event
types — one of them featured at the top, the rest grouped under each team
and person. Docs stay at `/docs`.

## Optional blog

Set `BLOG_ENABLED = "1"` in this instance's `[vars]` and apply migrations
before deploying. Unset or `"0"` keeps all blog routes off, without reading
blog data. Other applications can continue using the fork with no blog enabled.

Instance admins manage drafts and published posts at `/dashboard/blog`
(or the **Manage blog posts** link in Admin), using the existing session and
CSRF protection. The editor accepts plain text, an excerpt and an optional
HTTPS cover image URL. Text is escaped when rendered; it is never executed as
HTML. Cover images remain at their HTTPS source; this module does not upload them.

Public HTML lives at `/blog` and `/blog/:slug`. Custom websites can read
`GET /api/blog` (`{ posts: [...] }`) and `GET /api/blog/:slug`
(`{ post: {...} }`). Public fields are `id`, `title`, `slug`, `excerpt`,
`body` (plain text), `image` (URL or null), and `updatedAt` (ISO timestamp).
Only published posts are returned; lists contain the latest 100. Responses
use `Cache-Control: no-store` so unpublishing does not leave a cached article.

For a custom booking frontend, successful authenticated
`POST /api/v1/bookings` and `POST /api/v1/bookings/:id/reschedule` responses
include `links: { manage, cancel, reschedule }` alongside the existing `data`.
All three URLs open Punctual's guest management page, where the customer
confirms any change. Keep API keys on your website's server, never in the
browser. Links contain a guest credential: do not log or share them. List/read
responses and token-less idempotent replays do not expose these links.

## Upgrading

```bash
git pull
npm run migrate
npm run deploy
```

Migrations are forward-only and additive, and never assume you upgraded
recently, so skipping several versions is fine.

## What you get on the free tier

A team of ten scheduling normally sits far inside Cloudflare's free limits:
100,000 Worker requests a day, 5 GB of D1 storage, 5 million D1 row reads a
day.

Two features need a paid plan, and both degrade gracefully:

- **Queues** — emails and webhooks are delivered inline instead, on the request
  path, with no automatic retries. Everything still works; a failed send is
  simply not retried.
- **Read replication** — without it, D1 reads go to your database's home
  region. Fine for a team in one place; noticeable if your guests are global.
  Enable it later with one API call, no code change.

## Configuration reference

| Variable | Where | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `BASE_URL` | `[vars]` | Public origin; used in links and emails |
| `BRAND_NAME` | `[vars]` | Shown in the footer and emails |
| `LEGAL_OPERATOR` | `[vars]` | Data controller named on `/privacy` and `/terms`. Defaults to `BRAND_NAME` — set this to your actual legal entity if you're taking this past internal/team use |
| `FROM_EMAIL` / `FROM_NAME` | `[vars]` | Sender identity |
| `SUPPORT_EMAIL` | `[vars]` | Reply-to on outbound mail |
| `TELEMETRY_ENABLED` | `[vars]` | `0` by default. See below |
| `SIGNUPS` | secret or `[vars]` | Pins the sign-up policy: `open`, `closed`, or a comma list of emails and `@domains`. Unset (the default), admins manage it from the dashboard's Admin page instead — existing users always sign in either way |
| `DEMO_BOOKING_PATH` | `[vars]` | A live booking page on this deployment (e.g. `/jo/30min`), embedded on the landing page. Unset: no demo section |
| `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` | `[vars]` | Unset by default. A GA4 id (`G-XXXXXXXXXX`) loads Google Analytics on the marketing/docs pages ONLY — never on a booking page or the dashboard |
| `BLOG_ENABLED` | `[vars]` | Unset/`0` by default. Set to `1` to enable the D1-backed public blog at `/blog` and admin CRUD at `/dashboard/blog` |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY_V1` | secret | AES-GCM key for calendar tokens |
| `SIGNING_KEY` | secret | HMAC key for guest manage links |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `_SECRET` | secret | Your Google OAuth app |
| `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` / `_SECRET` | secret | Your Microsoft app |
| `[[send_email]]` | binding | Cloudflare Email Service — no key. Used when neither API key is set. Needs the sending domain onboarded (Compute → Email Service) and Workers Paid; until then guest sends fail while `/health` still reads healthy |
| `EMAIL_PROVIDER` | `[vars]` | Optional: `cloudflare`, `resend`, `brevo` or `console`. Names the sender instead of inferring it; a named provider whose key or binding is missing is reported on `/health` (`email_provider_unavailable`) and the dashboard instead of quietly falling back |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | secret | Omit to log emails instead of sending — `/health` and the dashboard both warn when neither key is set |
| `BREVO_API_KEY` | secret | Alternative to Resend; Resend wins if both are set |

## Telemetry

Off unless you set `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=1`.

When on, it sends one ping a day: a random instance id, the version, and counts
of users, event types and bookings. No names, no email addresses, no slugs, no
URLs, no calendar content. The whole payload is built in one short file —
`src/adapters/scheduled.ts` — so you can read exactly what leaves your Worker
rather than take our word for it.

## Troubleshooting

**"unverified app" on Google sign-in.** Expected until Google finishes
verification. Add yourself as a test user on the consent screen.

**Emails are not arriving, and you bound Cloudflare Email Service.** They are
not being logged — they are being rejected. Two usual causes: the sending
domain is not onboarded yet, or `FROM_EMAIL` is on a different domain than the
one you onboarded. `npx wrangler tail` names which.

**Emails are not arriving.** With no `RESEND_API_KEY` or `BREVO_API_KEY` they
are logged, not sent — bookings still commit and calendars still sync, so
nothing else looks wrong. Two places say so without your having to read logs:
the dashboard shows a standing banner on every page, and `/health` reports it:

```bash
curl -s https://your-deployment/health
# {"ok":true,"service":"punctual","emailDelivery":"console",
#  "warnings":["email_not_configured: ..."]}
```

`emailDelivery` is `resend`, `brevo` or `console`. `console` means nothing is
being delivered to anyone. `ok` stays `true` because the service itself is
up — point monitoring at `warnings` being non-empty, not at `ok`.

**Microsoft guests get two invitations.** Expected, and not something this
deployment can turn off. Outlook sends its own meeting request whenever an
event has attendees, and Microsoft documents that as mandatory with no opt-out
— so a guest booking with a Microsoft-connected host gets Punctual's
confirmation *and* Outlook's invite. Google's equivalent is suppressed
(`sendUpdates=none`), which is why Google guests get one. Punctual's own email
is the complete one: it carries the meeting link, the answers to your intake
questions, and the reschedule/cancel links.

**A co-host sees the meeting as an invitation, not as their own event.**
By design. A team booking is written once per calendar provider: the first
host with a connected calendar on that provider organizes the event, and
every other host on that provider is an attendee of it — so hosts see each
other and each other's responses on one shared event instead of N copies
each inviting the others. An attendee cannot edit the event; reschedule
and cancel go through Punctual, which updates the one event. Optional
hosts are marked optional in the invite. Hosts on the other provider get
that provider's event. A host with no calendar connected is listed on the
first event by email address, which only lands on their calendar if that
address is an account on that provider — they always get Punctual's own
host confirmation with the `.ics` attached, so nothing is lost either way.

**A host's calendar stopped syncing.** Their refresh token was revoked —
usually a password change or an admin policy. Their connections page shows a
reconnect prompt; existing bookings are unaffected.

**Times look wrong by an hour.** Almost always a host timezone set incorrectly
rather than a DST bug. The engine computes in UTC and converts at the edges,
and the DST behaviour is covered by tests across Kyiv, New York, Lord Howe
(30-minute DST), Chatham (+12:45) and Kolkata. If you find a genuine case,
please open an issue with the host timezone, guest timezone and date — that is
enough to reproduce it.
